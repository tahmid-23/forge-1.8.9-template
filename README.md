# Forge 1.8.9 Template

Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 template mod, with updated dependencies (Gradle 9, Essential Loom 1.13).

Known issues:
- DevAuth pinned to 1.2.1, since 1.2.2 uses JDK 11 class that causes some error spam

### Notes
This template is heavily inspired by https://github.com/lineargraph/Forge1.8.9Template/. Although that template works,
I prefer having a newer Gradle version and some opinionated build script choices.
